# digital-miniproject
This is my group repository for the Digital Miniproject - S8 SEI. This project focuses on the implementation of a Spiking Neural Network on Chip. The following are the description of contents in each folder as well as their purpose in the project.

## Literature

This folder contains only the PDF files from articles used in our project. It will be used to share literature between the project participants and also to organize references for the final report.

## Logisim

Will contain only files with extension `.circ` aimed to be used in the open-source software `Logisim` by Carl Burch. The file `async_lib.circ` is our personal asynchronous library with components such as muller gates, control blocks, fork, merge, etc.

## Verilog

Will contain all SystemVerilog files to be used for the circuit synthesis as well as simulation files associated with the software `ModelSim`. All SystemVerilog models and their specific testbenches are in the folder `rtl` and `bench` respectively.
